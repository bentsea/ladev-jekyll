Louisianime will be providing weapons check at the cosplay table on site at the convention. If you have a prop weapon you will need to have it checked. Props will be marked with a zip tie.

- Ammunition for replica guns and other projectile replica weapons will not be allowed.
- All replica guns must be marked with an orange safety tip
- Do not brandish and/or act irresponsibly with a weapon or prop. If you are found acting in a manor that is deemed irresponsible by staff your badge may be revoked.
- If staff cannot tell your weapon is a prop from 10 feet away, you probably should not bring it.
